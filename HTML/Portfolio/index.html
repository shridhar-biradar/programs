  </section>
    <p>I am <b>Shridhar Biradar </b>, a dedicated Computer Science Engineering graduate with a robust knowledge of programming languages, including Java, Python, HTML, and CSS. My educational background has equipped me with the technical skills necessary to tackle complex problems and develop innovative solutions. During my academic journey, I completed an internship where I collaborated on a next-word prediction project aimed at enhancing text input efficiency and user experience. This project, which utilized natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms with an LSTM model, not only honed my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation but also strengthened my ability to work collaboratively in a team setting. </p>
    <p> Beyond my technical expertise, I am an avid chess player, finding the strategic depth and intellectual challenge of the game both stimulating and rewarding. Chess has taught me the importance of critical thinking, patience, and foresight, skills that I find invaluable in my professional life. I am also committed to continuous learning and self-improvement, regularly engaging in activities that broaden my knowledge and enhance my skill set.</p>

    <p>In addition to my technical and recreational pursuits, I maintain several good habits that contribute to my personal and professional growth. I prioritize time management, ensuring that I efficiently balance work, study, and leisure. I am proactive in seeking feedback and am always eager to learn from others. Furthermore, I believe in the importance of mindfulness, regularly practicing yoga and meditation to maintain a healthy mind and body. These habits not only improve my productivity but also foster a well-rounded and balanced approach to life. </p>
